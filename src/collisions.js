/**
 * Collision detection & resolution
 *
 * Uses impulse-based restitution model (report §1.4):
 * - Detect contact each substep via distance check
 * - Resolve with standard 3D restitution impulse along contact normal
 * - Conserves momentum and applies coefficient of restitution e
 *
 * Default method: instantaneous impulse (efficient, matches case studies)
 *
 * NOTE: A Hertzian contact mode (§4.2–4.3, using stiffness H_k from Table 1)
 * is not implemented here — the report uses instantaneous-impulse as its
 * primary model (§1.4) for all case studies in Ch. 7, and describes Hertz
 * contact as an optional higher-fidelity refinement. The instantaneous
 * model is sufficient for the report's validation scope.
 *
 * For unequal masses, the general restitution formulas (correction #6):
 *   v₁' = [(m₁ - e·m₂)v₁ + (1+e)m₂v₂] / (m₁+m₂)
 *   v₂' = [(1+e)m₁v₁ + (m₂ - e·m₁)v₂] / (m₁+m₂)
